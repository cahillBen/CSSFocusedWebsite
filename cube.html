        <h1>Rubik's Cube</h1>

        <p>
            This is the most challenging hobby to get started at.
            It's all about algorithms and recognising paterns.
            You'll find yourself relying on video tutorials to learn these algorithms but once you learn them, you'll be
            able to solve any rubik's cube.

            <h2>Knowing your Cube</h2>
            <p>There's a few things to know before you start trying to solve the cube:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pieces are the bits that move, <b>one piece can have different colours</b> on them</li>
                <li>Corner pieces are the pieces in the corner, they have 3 colours</li>
                <li>Middle pieces are always between the corner pieces</li>
                <li>The centre squares never move, the white centre will always be opposite the yellow etc.</li>
                <li>There are 6 faces: <b>Top, Bottom, Left, Right, Front, Back</b></li>
                <li>To use these properly, you must always have the correct colour centre piece is facing you</li>
                <li>Every possible move can be referred to as a certain face going <em>clockwise</em> or
                    <em>anti-clockwise</em></li>
                <li>And that's it!!!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>
                I will only be going through the first few steps to completing a rubik's cube.
                If you'd like learn every step, I'd recommend the <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmnSpUgOvyI">video</a> I used to learn.
                They will work no matter how the cube has been mixed up.

                <h3>Step 1 - Daisy Chain</h3>

                    </a>

                    <p>
                        Start with the yellow centre facing you.
                        Move the 4 middle white pieces to form a Daisy.
                        There are only 3 ways these places these pieces can be positioned.
                        It may take a few turns to practice all of these.
                        Make note of the colours on the <em>other</em> side of the middle white pieces.

                <h3>Step 2 - White Cross</h3>
                <section>
                    <a href="images/cube/halfTurn.jpg">
                        <img src="images/cube/halfTurn.jpg" alt="Shows face about to be turned 180" />
                    </a>

                    <p>
                        Pick a white middle piece, look at the other colour on the piece.
                        Line this up with the centre of the same colour by moving the yellow face.
                        When the colour is next to the correct centre, rotate that centre 180&deg;.
                        Do this for every middle white in the daisy.
                        It should leave you with a white cross on the <em>other</em> side.

                    <p>
                        Put the white corners into place by rotating one white side down to slot in the correct piece.
                        You will know its the correct piece if the other 2 colours on it end up on their colour's face
                        Make you still have your white cross.
                        <b>Don't rotate the white face</b> (You will never need to).

            <p>
                If you're looking to learn the final steps, I'd highly recommend using the same video I did by
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf8swKDQaBFOQ5Pvk2sba7g">Noah Richardson</a>
                which was recommended to me by a friend who knows a lot more about Speed Cubes than me.
                The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmnSpUgOvyI">video</a> is only 20 minutes long
                and goes into much more detail than I could.
